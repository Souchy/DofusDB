    "32355": "Red-Hot Wand",
    "32356": "This wand is searingly hot to the touch. But the most enigmatic thing about it is its ash smell which would make you think it had survived a forest fire.",

    "32360": "This terrible root is mainly known for its capacity to provoke climatic disasters at the exact place where it's been used. Avoid using it to kick your enemies around.

    "32464": "The Flud is not really a hat. It's more of a parasite that tends to develop on loud or aggressive people's heads. Its disgusting appearance repels all and sundry, compelling its wearer to scream even louder which is useless since these people have nothing to say anyway.",
    "32466": "A short-sighted, grumbling, fortune telling, smelly old Feca accidentally created this powerful weapon when her staff rammed into her crystal ball as she slipped from the kitchen table.

Mind you, they also say that carrying it will help you overcome your fear of water, give you the courage to quit your menial job, and that it has the power to burn down houses, so I'd take that with a pinch of salt if I were you.",
    "350546": "Unstable Belt",
    "350547": "This belt isn't called \"unstable\" because it's about to self-destruct, invert gravity or send you crazy, it just doesn't hold your trousers up very well.",
    "350548": "Age-Old Helmet",
    "350549": "It's hard to imagine Count Harebourg in a helm like this. Mind you, everyone goes through a rebellious stage, and to be fair, his has lasted more than a century.",
    "350550": "Count Harebourg's Boots",
    "350551": "Between his castle, his soul, his island and his monsters, Count Harebourg's feet are the only things that aren't frozen solid thanks to these boots.",

    "350554": "Count Harebourg's Hat",
    "350555": "Count Harebourg was forced to become a recluse after the big freeze, but even back then, no living soul had ever seen his face. What is he hiding behind this hat, and what transformations has that face undergone after all these years?",
    "350556": "Kan-O-Mat Amulet",
    "350557": "The reverse of this amulet can be opened up to reveal a secret compartment. It looks like you've got washing powder for your Kan-O-Mat Cloak hidden in yours.",

    "350562": "Sylargh's Strap",
    "350563": "This isn't really Sylargh's belt, it would be much too big for him. His is actually a rather simple affair, crafted from a single strap and a gearwheel, the Imp's tools of the trade. I bet you paid a fortune for this knockoff, didn't you?",
    "350566": "Sylargh's Hood",
    "350567": "If we excuse Sylargh's antics, his villainy and his impertinence, it's not because he hides behind this hood, but because he's just a child. Whether that makes you feel better or worse tells me everything I need to know about you.",
    "350568": "Glacial Ring",
    "350569": "If your ring finger wasn't already a frostbitten stump, it certainly will be now.",
    "350570": "Glacial Belt",
    "350571": "No one's sure exactly how this belt works, but it seems to allow male wearers to keep a cool head in even the most stressful situations. It would appear that a thousand years of classical cerebral anatomy was wrong, and the housewives of Frigost might be on to something after all.",
    "350574": "Nileza's Amulet",
    "350575": "The symbol on Nileza's amulet refers to his love of science, his intelligence, his vast knowledge, and more specifically, his mastery of the elements. You'll notice it doesn't describe anything about his mental state, however.",
    "350576": "Unstable Ring",

    "350578": "Unstable Band",
    "350579": "This ring is a little bit too big for you and chafes your finger, which is very painful. It also looks like it's about to explode, which would be even more painful.",

    "350587": "Members of a Frigostian criminal organisation sell this hat to naïve tourists, who are told they have to wear it all the time if they want free travel across the frozen island. It makes them loads more money than their previous racket - selling Mastogob Black Pudding pizzas.",
    "350588": "Missiz Freezz's Helmet",
    "350589": "Missiz Freezz's helmet is a near-perfect example of her incredible talent for smithmagic and item modification. It's so well made that despite it being infinitely lighter and far easier to carry than a bog-standard helmet, it protects her head just as well.",

    "350593": "As long as your toes are strong enough, you can use the soles of these boots to help you hang upside-down from the branches of trees. Not a particularly useful skill, you have to admit.",
    "350594": "Treadfast Belt",
    "350595": "Treadfasts attach the remains of their prey to the razor-sharp claws on this belt, so they've always got something to snack on within easy reach. I'd warn you to keep your hands away from them, if you weren't always fumbling around in your pockets.",
    "350596": "Nocturnowl Boots",

    "350598": "Nocturnowl Belt",
    "350599": "When a Nocturnowl struggles to digest part of its meal, it spits it out in the form of a pellet. You'll find these pellets all over the Count's castle, and if you pull one apart, you'll find all kinds of things - adventurer bones, Nocturnowl feathers, and the bitter tang of frustration.",
    "350600": "Cycloid Boots",
    "350601": "These boots were made for walking at the rate of one step a second. Great if you want to walk somewhere without expending much energy, but not so great if you're attempting to escape an imminent death.",

    "350604": "Cycloid Amulet",
    "350605": "Using the Cycloid eye in this amulet as a monocle might let you see disturbances in the spacetime continuum, but you'll look like a complete berk doing so.",
    "350606": "Cryochrone Amulet",
    "350607": "Anything that disappears into the hole in this amulet reappears in another era. No, don't even think about it - the process requires that the \"subject\" be cryogenically frozen beforehand.",
    "350608": "Bubotron Sword",
    "350609": "Count Harebourg presented this sword as a gift during the Bubotron's dubbing ceremony. It symbolises the owl's rank amongst the Sinistros, but as the Bubotron has no hands, it is of no use to him whatsoever.",
    "350610": "Bubotron Amulet",
    "350611": "Bubotrons can turn their heads through 270 degrees, but are often confused by the sudden rotation. This amulet plays a vital role in allowing the dozy owls to remember the direction they should actually be facing.",
    "350612": "Sinistrofu Amulet",
    "350613": "A Sinistrofu doesn't have a neck, so why would it need an amulet? Is this even an amulet at all? You'd prefer not to find out.",
    "350614": "Sinistrofu Cloak",
    "350615": "This cape was woven from filoplumes, tiny, feathery sensors that allow you to feel the changes in air pressure caused by an enemy sneaking up behind you. You've got to admit, that's pretty coo-owl. Oh come on, that wasn't that bad!",
    "350616": "Cryochrone Helmet",
    "350617": "Count Harebourg wore this helmet to manipulate time. If you can use it as a welding helmet, it will be an achievement.",
    "350618": "Sinistrofu Boots",
    "350619": "Sinistrofus have asymmetric ears that allow them to pinpoint the source of any sudden noise. The only asymmetric thing about you is your feet, so don't attempt to do the same thing or you'll fall over.",
    "350620": "Cryochrone Ring",
    "350621": "This ring, one of Count Harebourg's inventions, can predict when the weather is going to be cold up to a week in advance. Unsurprisingly, there's never been any great call for it on Frigost.",
    "350622": "Age-Old Amulet",
    "350623": "Looking at this amulet, it's plain to see that very little has changed over the past hundred years when it comes to jewellery.",
    "350624": "Bubotron Mask",
    "350625": "Like any good aristocrat, the Bubotron loves a good masked ball, but much to his great annoyance, he's never allowed to take part. The doormen always turn him away for not wearing a mask, even though he's quite clearly wearing this one.",
    "350626": "Age-Old Belt",
    "350627": "This belt is the only piece of equipment that the Count was wearing before the big freeze that he still wears now, mainly because the clasp froze solid when Djaul cast his curse, and Harebourg has been unable to take it off ever since.",
    "350646": "Magmatic Diving Bell",
    "350647": "After expert handling by a Fogger who appeared to know just what he was doing, this diving bell looks to be in prime condition! Now you'll be able to enter the Geofurnaces without being asphyxiated by the sulphur fumes, which is always nice. On the downside, the window barely lets any light through, so you shouldn't wear it for fighting or for any activity requiring good eyesight. And I bet your life's ambition was to wear your Magmatic Diving Bell whilst combing through your mother-in-law's hair looking for nits. Sorry about that!",
    "350672": "Copper Nickus Ring",
    "350673": "Copper Nickus was a heretic polymath who dared to suggest that the World of Twelve wasn't at the centre of the Krosmoz. No traces of his body were ever found, and this ring is his only surviving relic. Wear it with care.",
    "350677": "A long time ago, Klime would use the needle on this belt to stitch up the broken things he found and they would return to perfect health. These days he uses it to pick apart the healthy things he finds until they're perfectly broken.",
    "350678": "Vicious Hat",
    "350679": "Klime wears this hat to avoid being deafened by the cries of the victims he brings to the back room of his private quarters, and also to avoid having his head knocked off by their jerking limbs. It's important to look one's best at all times, after all.",
    "350681": "All the best costumiers have their little foibles, and Klime is clearly no exception. He may well have a sharp eye for fashion, but he's terribly sadistic, and no one has ever seen him without his mask - no one alive, that is. That probably goes a long way to explaining why Carla Garfield wears those sunglasses all the time.",
    "350683": "The lining of this cape wasn't blood red when it was first stitched, it's just been dragged one too many times across the floor of the back room in Klime's private quarters.",
    "350684": "Vicious Boots",
    "350685": "Klime was known throughout the World of Twelve for the beauty of his creations, but since his arrival on Frigost, and due in part to the sordid magic he breathes into them, they've been getting uglier the more powerful they get. Well, at least these boots look nice.",
    "350686": "Glacial Cape",
    "350687": "Wearing this cape will make you so cold you may as well not bother putting it on, so give it to me instead.",
    "350688": "Vicious Ring",

    "350690": "Stilted Shovel",
    "350691": "Stilted Shovels are known for their unusual tendency to refuse to dig. As this is a particularly inconvenient quality for a shovel, the Enutrofs of the Asse Sea strap them vertically to their legs instead. This allows the stumpy treasure hunters to walk freely across the rolling sand dunes, and also makes them appear much taller than they really are.",
    "350714": "Inferno's Boots",

    "350717": "Augilol was a non-descript Sram who spent his whole, miserable life in Ogivol's shadow. When Frigost Island was rediscovered, he was one of the first passengers to make the journey, hoping to come into his own and make his fortune. We don't know what happened next. All that's left of him is this cloak.",
    "350718": "Nekochief",
    "350719": "This hat was designed by a tailor who adored Bow Meows and was vehemently opposed to the Systematic Termination For Undesirable Bow Meows association.

    "350736": "Mandrin's Boots",

    "375819": "The Black Ninja's amulet holds dark and terrible powers, remnant of ancient times, which according to the legend are powerful enough to kill even a god.

    "765775": "This little dragon's skin is as pink as a bodacious Bwork's backside, making it a risk-free and cheap thing to fantasise about, or just a nice reminder of happy times. Luckily for the dragon, it's not just something for you to lust after. It is also a very wise and powerful creature. A word of warning, however: its hunger for other pets is as great as a Chafer's wickedness during a full moon.",
    "765777": "Tamed and cleaned, this baby Minotoror can be approached and petted without fear of losing fingers or hands. Don't let down your guard, though, as sometimes nature can reclaim control, and the creature's destructive instincts will take over just when you need its help most.

    "765792": "Willy Peninzias is a nasty creature indeed, and seems to have had a very tough childhood. Count on it to follow you around and scare your friends away.",
    "765794": "This small creature is a Bwork that was locked inside a jar for several decades. It took the shape of the jar as it grew, and will now be a dwarf the rest of its life.

    "765801": "Ross is the favourite pet of the famous Master Black Jack. Don't be put off by its appearance, it can be really fearsome in battle.",
    "765802": "Thanks to this pet, anyone of the opposite sex will be making eyes at you. Don't gloat too much, though. Very soon, you'll realise that your suitor has been hypnotised by Feanor. It won't be much of an advantage either: from then on, your admirer will only eat raw Snapper and rub up against your legs... Sounds romantic, doesn't it?",
    "765803": "This Gobtubby seems perfectly normal, other than its wool being black in parts... Give it time and you might be surprised!",
    "765804": "This little ball of fur is more resistant to the cold than an ordinary Bow Meow. It's softer to stroke, but it's even more annoying than its short-haired cousin.",
    "765805": "This creature is a little stupid. The only way to make it move forward is to attach a Cawwot and stick to its back. Fortunately, it has been well trained, so it won't be breaking wind in a panic.",
    "765806": "This Minimino was brought up by Minotot himself. Unfortunately, the beast's character rubbed off on the innocent creature, along with some nasty body odours from being cuddled.",
    "765807": "Don't be fooled: this creature's pointed teeth will end up in your backside one day, that's for sure.",
    "765808": "Take a Pink Dragoone, plunge it into a pot of black dye, throw some gold dust on it, dip it in oil, then water – now you have a Black Dragoone.",
    "765814": "More golden than a Black Dragoone, less pink than a Pink Dragoone, and rarer than a Skeleton Dragoone, this pet will draw all eyes towards you, even if you're as ugly as a Piwi.",
    "765815": "This Arachnee is very badly behaved: it jumps around, screams all the time, and bites anyone it meets... but for some reason you still love it.",
    "765816": "This unique Mush Mush was raised by a pack of Boowolves, which still doesn't explain why it has such hairy armpits.",
    "765817": "This Tofu was struck by lightning 11 times while still growing. It'll give you an electric shock if you stroke it, and it'll shock you with electricity if you don't stroke it. The choice is yours.",
    "765818": "This pet loves artichoke hearts smothered in Bherb blood, endives with Pikoko hair, and Jon Lemon's songs. It seems to enjoy your company as well.",
    "765821": "This pet may have stripes, but that won't stop it from sniffing your bottom or trying to relieve itself on your carpet. What did you expect?",
    "765822": "This ugly little Black Quaquack was rejected by its own family because it was different: it loved listening to the songs of Jon Lemon, the famous minstrel. Maybe it was just misunderstood.",
    "765823": "This pet stayed out too long in acid rain. It doesn't glow in the dark, nor is it magical, but you can make a very potent salad dressing from it.",
    "765824": "This strange creature crossed the oceans on a block of ice to escape from a lost port. It looks like it's taken you for a block of ice.",
    "765825": "This little fuzzball hates being stroked the wrong way, although you're not actually sure which is the right way to stroke it.",
    "765826": "Yes, it floats. Don't ask.",
    "765827": "This little pet will take care of your nuts by running off and hiding them somewhere. Don't expect to find them again, however, as it won't remember where it's hidden them.",
    "765828": "Grumpier than a Minifoux but with far less hairy armpits, this pet is renowned for having bitten Dame Antium without breaking a single tooth.",
    "765830": "Feared by other pets because of teeth that would make a vampire blush, this creature had a lonely childhood and its social skills suffered. Until you adopted it, that is.",
    "765831": "Once fully grown, this pet will radiate a wonderful Frigostian charm, and like its Amaknian cousin, it loves to cuddle. In the meantime, it will give you lots of kisses to show its affection.",
    "765833": "This little Bearbarian cub escaped from Professor Obsidian-Heart's laboratory and was rescued by Granny Capping. Starved of affection, it will try to kiss you all the time, so you should probably rub antiseptic cream around your mouth to avoid getting stubble rash.",
    "765834": "As old and as stylish as an Enutrof, and as affectionate as the Eliatrope Goddess, this Platypus shines day and night. The children's stories give its home as Sufokia, and raise it to the status of the remains of an ancient civilization, but the veracity of these claims has never been verified.",
    "765837": "A reward for adventurers who have proved their worth by defeating Grozilla and Grasmera several times during their period of semi-dormancy, this Madreggon is very popular among the people of Astrub.",
    "765838": "A loyal hunting companion of Goblimps who travel the Taiga, the Slayhound's bite is worse than its bark.",
    "765840": "Mouselet is the most voracious vegetarian in all Amakna. Its favourite hobbies include upsetting the Api cart and getting rid of the bad eggs, so it can have its cake and eat it too. And they say carnivores are bloodthirsty...",
    "765843": "When you chose to adopt the Moowitty, you might have expected a pet who's a laugh a minute. Unfortunately, it's not half as funny as its name would have you believe. A fan of crude jokes in bad taste, the Moowitty will have you at your wit's end. It's been banned from the Moowolf Lair and the Sidimote Moors.",
    "765852": "Luckily for you, Fosfor is one of the only survivors of the Abandoned Labowatowies that isn't toxic to touch. Well, he was only discovered recently, so who knows what might happen, but he's probably safe. Either way, he's the most charming night-light you've ever had.",
    "765853": "If you think you've adopted a pet which will snooze peacefully by the hearth, you're in for a shock. The Bowzai's ferociousness is inversely proportional to its size, and it spends all day yowling, hissing and scratching everything to pieces. It also loves to stare at you whilst sniggering, which is neither cute nor reassuring.",
    "765854": "It's not so much bravery as the fact that the bandana slips down over its eyes that the Black Tiwabbit always charges headlong into enemies... and allies. It makes for a great diversion tactic, though!",
    "765855": "This pet is crazy about kamas and goes nuts when it smells any nearby! Some boutiques use Snoofles as kama detectors to determine whether their customers have money to spend there or not. The only downside is that when someone asks if you can spare a few kamas, you can't pretend not to have any...",
    "765856": "For generations, all the members of the Homlett family have been the servants of a powerful necromancer. They're so loyal that they continue to serve their master after their own demise, in the form of talking skulls. Dead or alive, they remain loyal. \"To be or not to be\" is not a question the Homletts have asked.",
    "765857": "This pet rolls up in a ball at the slightest hint of danger. Then, depending on how the ground tilts, he'll roll randomly in one direction and can sometimes work as a distraction.",
    "765858": "\"You shall not pass!\" \nThese words suit your new pet to a tee. Still, don't expect it to stand between you and certain death, as it lacks both courage and muscles.",
    "765859": "The Eliom is a mischievous, chatty spirit that tends to show up around portals created by the Eliotropes. Legends claim that the Eliom is a wandering soul which is not ready for reincarnation just yet. Although it can be irritating, even annoying at times, the Eliom is not evil at heart... It just likes to get into people's ears with its shrill voice.",
    "765860": "Friendrakes are born in an enormous cavern discovered by the Eliotropes beneath the waters of Sufokia. These miniature dragons have long lacked affection, and they make for extremely loyal companions. When a Friendrake adopts you, it's for life! When you go on nights out with your fellow adventurers, you can count on your Friendrake to warm up the room and lighten the mood with the funny faces it makes.",
    "765861": "The Tanuks don't hit puberty for a few decades, but when they do they gain both their independence and a ferocious temper. Before adolescence they're as docile as a lazy Bow Meow, but it's impossible to tell the males from the females, since their distinguishing features, at this age, haven't grown much bigger than their tails. The poachers working in Pandala make a nice bit of money from the trafficking of these creatures, to which you are contributing by taking this little Tanuk under your wing.",
    "765862": "Although not quite as cute as a Konalak, you'll feel just as much need to take care of it, to cuddle it, to stroke its head and to rub your face against its soft fur.",
    "765863": "The result of Doctor Morose's experiments, the Mastostroke was created by repeatedly crossing Angora Bow Meows with Evil Dandelions. Its mischievous character, inherited from its gene pool, has made it the target of much Iopery.",
    "765864": "Bontarians are fond of the Bontick's loyalty and devotion, although others find it a bit too clingy. Once it's decided it likes you, you'll be stuck together like glue and the bond it's formed will be unbreakable, no matter how hard you try. You'll never be alone, not even in the bathroom.",
    "765865": "Brakarinas are a real pain in the neck. After the extermination of Brakmar's Vilinsekts, they spread like a plague through the houses. You'll find them creepy crawling in your mattresses, carpets and household linens. Some Brakmarians like their cantankerous nature and keep them as pets.",
    "765866": "The Groogler is one of the most curious animals in all the World of Twelve. Its bulging eyes and flat face give it a particularly ridiculous appearance, while its spiky crest and ample tail evoke a ferocious beast. So many contradictions in such a little creature...",
    "765867": "Unfortunately, heartfelt kisses aren't enough to keep your Minikron fed.",
    "765868": "More agile than a Tofu at dinner time, the Maulleycat surprises its prey with its extreme speed, which makes it an exceptional predator, and also uncatchable. It's said that anyone that can tame the beast while naked will acquire its speed.",
    "765869": "Generally causing onomatopaeic spasms and hot flashes among lovers of cute things, Kerubabies are adorable little Kikitties raised in the Ecaflipus Dimension. Nobody knows if the magical aura that resides there is the reason they look like Kerub.",
    "765870": "Straight from the Depths of Sufokia, this Glub owes its name to the sounds it makes when you pull it out of an underwater cavity – its natural habitat. Its cuddly side and its funny shape make it Trituns' best friend.",
    "765871": "Ratchams are often mistaken for rats, due to their tail, long ears and lack of bodily hair. But if you adopt one, you'll soon find out how little this pawed predator has in common with a rodent. As cuddly as they come, it'll lick your face, and you'll discover that no, Ratchams are not completely lacking in hair.",
    "765872": "If in some dreadfully unfortunate circumstance, someone were to push granny into a bunch of cacti, don't worry! Dauge won't hesitate for a second before helping her and becoming the sole beneficiary of her will.",
    "765873": "Thing is a hand that can think, write and act by itself. It's a very obliging creature. It's believed that it once worked for the prestigious Dadums family from Forfut. However, they used this hand in ways we wouldn't want to mention in polite company, and it was eventually driven to run away and find a less twisted owner. It happened to find you, and there's a good chance you won't be much better than the Dadums family. Thing's destiny is nothing if not tragic.",
    "765877": "A ridiculous giant Borbat, the Skrot is an unfailingly faithful mount. Its love for you will manifest itself in many ways: sometimes it will lick you from head to toe, and it won't hesitate to swallow and suck on the former! Never has such an affectionate animal been seen, so long as it doesn't take you for its next snack...",
    "765879": "Gobbalator has been training for war since he was a nipper. He can open a can of beer or a Brakmarian's head with his teeth alone.",
    "765880": "Gobbalux has been training for war since he was a nipper. He can skewer barbecued meat or a Bontarian's forehead with just a jab of his horns.",
    "765887": "You'll be saying \"wow\" and taking bows every time you take this tiny Bow Wow out to do its business. Due to its wild nature, this pet should not be fed – that is, unless you want to lose a hand.",
    "765888": "In levels of sheer idiocy, the Tofu, the Gobball and even the Iop can't hold a candle to the Quaquack.",
    "765889": "You'll be saying \"wow\" and taking bows every time you take this tiny Bow Wow out to do its business. Due to its wild nature, this pet should not be fed – that is, unless you want to lose a hand.",
    "765890": "The fairer sex of any class will fall under the spell of this cuddly little ball of fluff. That alone makes it an animal to be feared.",
    "765891": "This fluffy ball of hair scratches, bites, and pinches everything that comes close, including the hand that feeds it! It's a terrifying yet irresistibly likeable and fascinating creature.",
    "765892": "This pet's pleasant company more than makes up for its breath, which smells strongly of dried fish.",
    "766154": "Equipped with this golden helmet, your head will soon be up for auction and worth its weight in gold.",
    "766156": "This fabric cloak, coated with a thin layer of gold, is magical. It attracts attention and reflects light directly into the pupils of dishonest types who try to stab you from behind. Essential if you have Sram friends.",
    "767018": "Snowdrift",
    "767037": "This petsmount is completely unable to keep its head out of the clouds, preferring to embark on wild flights of fancy and going wherever the wind blows. It likes to dream of a place where it can roam freely without adventurers always trying to mount it.",
    "767038": "Brulay is a bit of a hot-head with a short fuse. You'd better not upset him if you'd like to keep your butt out of the fire.",
    "767039": "Kwyness will surely satisfy your taste for luxury. The custom leather saddle alone will make for a unique flying experience, not to mention the aerodynamic feathers. But you'll have to cater to its whims – Sir Kwak doesn't sleep in just any nest, you know.",
    "767040": "Quite unlike Sirocco, Kompost is very down-to-earth, undoubtedly the perfect companion for those with their head in the clouds. He'll keep your feet solidly on the ground, forcefully if need be.",
    "767041": "Dehluge and Brulay get along quite well, despite their very opposite temperaments: while Brulay tends to be hot-headed, Dehluge prefers the path of least resistance. However, he's definitely not afraid to dive in and get his feet wet.",
    "767042": "Drhexler is an all-terrain petsmount. He'll trek on, unaffected by the longest journeys and the toughest climates. He's so insensitive, in fact, that he won't even notice if you fall off his back; he'll just soldier on into the sunset without you.",
    "767341": "A young Cra named Colette lost her head in Eltneg Wood. The poor girl stepped in the way of Brouce Boulgoure's hatchet, which he threw thinking she was a giant fern. Lucky she didn't live – she would have died had she found out she looked like a giant fern.",

They are placed on free cells that do not have traps on them.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nPortals are used to teleport entities that move onto or are positioned on them (allies, enemies, monsters, etc.), and to launch spells through them.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nSpells have increased damage and healing when launched through portals. The farther away from each other the portals are, the higher the bonus.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n<subtitle>Network and Redirection:</subtitle>\nPortals are connected to each other, forming a \"network\". There must be 2 active portals for a network to form.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nSpells cast through a portal, as well as push or pull manoeuvres that send an entity into a portal, \"project\" the spell or entity through the exit portal. This projection functions as a vector, which maintains the distance and direction of the spell casting or movement to determine the destination cell.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nAn entity or spell that enters the network will go from the \"entrance portal\" to the nearest portal, and so on without passing through the same portal twice, to arrive at the last portal, the \"exit portal\".\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nIf several portals are an equal distance apart, timing is prioritised to determine the order in which portals are travelled through by a spell or relocated entity.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nHovering the mouse over the network will offer a preview of how it redirects spells and relocations.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWeapons cannot be used through portals.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n<subtitle>Destination Cell:</subtitle>\nIf the destination portal is unavailable (occupied by an entity or an obstacle), the portal cannot be used. A portal cannot be placed on a cell already containing a portal.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nLine-of-sight restrictions still apply to spells even if they are cast through a network and the theoretical destination cell is located behind an obstacle.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nDepending on how an entity or spell enters the network, the destination cell differs:\n<br></br>\n<li>Via walking: the entity arrives at the cell where the destination portal is located.</li>\n<li>Via (spell) casting: the entity arrives at the cell using the vector between the caster's position and the entrance portal.</li>\n<li>Via teleportation: the entity arrives at the cell using the vector between the caster's position and the entrance portal.</li>\n<li>By being pushed: the entity arrives at the cell where the destination portal is located. If the push manoeuvre is interrupted by the entrance portal, the \"missing\" push is applied from the destination cell (using the push vector).</li>\n<li>By being pulled: the entity arrives at the cell where the destination portal is located. If the pull manoeuvre is interrupted by the entrance portal, the \"missing\" pull is applied from the destination cell (using the pull vector).</li>\n<subtitle>Portals and Teams:</subtitle>\nPortals take the colour of their team (red or blue). A team is limited to 4 portals, even if there are several Eliotropes on the team.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThe networks of two enemy Eliotropes will not communicate with each other.  However, all portals can be used by either allies or enemies.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nEnemies (not including summons) are unable to pass through an enemy portal on the first turn of the game.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWhen an Eliotrope dies, their portals disappear.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n<subtitle>Activation:</subtitle>\nWhen a portal is placed, it is open by default and therefore part of a network.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nPortals can be closed using the Neutral and Interruption spells. A closed portal is no longer part of the network of portals until the start of the Eliotrope's next turn.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThe Neutral spell is not cast through the network; it directly closes the targeted portal.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nOn the contrary, the Portal spell can be cast through a network.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nStanding on a deactivated portal that becomes active again will not teleport the entity.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nCasting a spell through a portal network doesn't deactivate the portals. A character may therefore cast spells through it as many times as they want during their turn.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nHowever, if an entity walks into or is moved into the network, the entrance and exit portals will be inactive for the entity's current turn, to be reactivated at the start of the next active entity's turn.\n<subtitle>Order:</subtitle>\nPortals are numbered from 1 to 4. The first portal placed is number 1, and the following portals go up to 4.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWhen an Eliotrope or their team can't set down any more portals, placing another portal will replace the oldest one.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThe new portal then becomes number 4, number 2 becomes 1, and so on.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nHovering the mouse over a portal will show the order of portals.",

    "926478": "\"Septangel 12 of the year 26. The dawn was cold, and light could barely penetrate the morning gloom. The Bontarian outposts, held by the knights of the Order, were white with the first signs of frost, the sentinels numb from the early onset of winter. They huddled around the braziers, trying in vain to warm up. The forest, whose multitude of little noises usually started rustling to life at this hour of the morning, was completely silent but for a cry that had been heard several times during the night. At first, the sentinels had paid it no heed, but now they squinted into the distance towards its apparent source in the south. The cry – which they couldn't believe had come from the throat of any ordinary creature – was getting closer.\n\n\"Crimson Dawn: Found Fragments, Volume IX\"",
    "926479": "\"At his command, the ghosts of the knights of the Order of the Valiant Heart arose. Their discarded armour hit the ground with metallic clangs and thuds. Burnt, flayed and cut, they all bore gaping wounds. Raval walked through the ranks in silence, then pointed towards the Brakmarian army. Hyrkul's troops had reached the gates of Bonta. Any minute now, they were sure to give way to the Trools' steady hammering. Militia men under Jiva's command had formed a wall of armour. But goblins were already trying to sneak in through the gaps in the door, which were widening with each passing second. Hyrkul had put his sword back in its sheath and was striking heavy blows with his mace. All of a sudden, he paused mid-motion, and turned back as though someone had called out to him...\"\n\n\"Crimson Dawn: Found Fragments, Volume X\"",
    "926480": "\"Cries of distress were coming from the rear. The huge warrior, taken aback, paused to listen carefully. But it was not the cries of fear that worried him. He had cast his eyes to the south. There, he saw his troops being overcome by the knights of the Order – the very knights he had killed with his black lightning! A white tide rolled slowly over the Brakmarians. Just then, Bonta's horns rang out. Jiva had opened up the doors and the militia was moving forward to take on the Brakmarian troops, taking back the ground that had been conquered, metre by metre.\"\n\n\"Crimson Dawn: Found Fragments, Volume X\"",
    "926481": "\"My name is Hyrkul, and it'll follow you into the other world, centaur!\" roared the enemy, and both of them rushed forward to strike. In less than a second, everything was over. Menalt brandished his spear, whose point glowed with white fire. He lunged forward, aiming at the hollow of the throat where there was just enough space between the plates of black armour for his blow to be lethal. But the warrior dodged and the spear jabbed uselessly into the darkness. Hyrkul's wide, shadowy wings swirled to lash and blind his opponent. Before the centaur could launch a second attack, Hyrkul grabbed his spear in one hand, and his throat in the other. They both bellowed – one in rage and the other in pain. A blaze of lightning sprang from the black helmet, hitting Menalt in the face for a few seconds that seemed like an eternity. Then the warrior pushed the stunned and twitching centaur back to deliver the deathblow. He twirled his sword; the blade spun with a whistling sound and cut swiftly downwards. Menalt dropped noiselessly into the dust.\"\n\n\"Crimson Dawn: Found Fragments, Volume X\"",
    "926482": "\"A dragon of black lightning materialised from the end of Hyrkul's sword. The beast reared up to its full height, towering over them all. It then dove downwards through the Bontarian troops. They caught fire instantly. Knights fell one after the other, and the other Bontarian warriors were blown away by the explosion. Pouchecot only survived thanks to his magic. He shot roots deep down into the earth, like a hundred-year-old tree. The battlefield was strewn with the cracked armour of fallen knights. A freezing rain started to pour down. The Brakmarian troops started to make their way towards Bonta. Hyrkul turned to face the gigantic tree that Pouchecot had become. His transformation had protected him from danger, but also prevented him from moving. The black giant roared with spine-chilling laughter.\n\n'I shall carve your coffin in your own wood, Pouchecot! But first... I want to see Jiva's head hanging in your branches!' He spat and strode away to join his army. The fortified walls of Bonta stood out in the distance, as pale as chalk.\"\n\n\"Crimson Dawn: Found Fragments, Volume X\"",
    "926484": "\"He struggled to extricate himself from the fray, and, knowing the battle was lost, Hyrkul glanced one last time at Bonta, so close, before fleeing towards the Treechnid Forest. He may not have been victorious, but now he knew for sure that Bonta did not have any Dofus. Jiva and Pouchecot would not have hesitated to brandish them at the battle's most critical moment, to show their power and scare the Brakmarian troops away... This simple detail was worth all the losses the troops of Brakmar had borne... Hyrkul disappeared into the dark forest.\"\n\n\"Crimson Dawn: Found Fragments, Volume X\"",

    "935263": "This belt was made to match Pandalida's favourite weapon, the Andy War Sword, perfectly. Simply decorated, the sabre has proven its worth in battle. This belt has not: the pieces of gold hanging from it make so much noise your enemies always hear every move you make.",
    "935264": "This belt, which protects its wearer's intimate parts, was designed specifically for Redroz supporters, since they're known for starting brawls in Gobbowl stadiums.",

    "935267": "Sula the shoemaker loved strolling in the fields, looking for improbable love. Instead of finding her soul mate, she fell into a huge ditch full of filth near the Pig Zone and died. Her body was found seventy years later, when they finally emptied the ditch. Her brother apparently said, \"We all have to go sometime,\" and them promptly fell into the ditch himself.",
    "935268": "Rumour has it that this belt was created by Captain Blooe himself. It defies belief, and yet you believe it all the same.",

    "935270": "Always prepared, Fecas keep survival supplies in a small bag. These supplies are mainly bread made from Crackrock stones. Not very tasty, but incredibly long lasting. The girdle belt firmly secures the bags around their waists. Even so, there are still way too many serious injuries caused by falling bags out of negligence or just plain stupidity.",
    "935271": "This belt cools the hips, nearby organs, and ardour of all who dare wear it. The perfect gift for your most stubborn suitors.",

    "935276": "The soles of these boots are covered with a sticky slime and the interior is filled with a slippery slime. Or maybe it's the other way round.",
    "935277": "Your legs will fear nothing when you're wearing these solid wood shin guards. Unfortunately, you can't wear them and boots at the same time. You can wear them for protection during gobbowl ball games, but your toes will take the full brunt of any toe pokers.",
    "935278": "Of modest origins, Feline has only ever been known to wear boots on her feet. To keep up her image as a diva, she asked one of the greatest cobblers in Frigost to find a dye that would turn them a pretty pink colour. He ended up taking his own life, unable to forgive himself for having created such a monster.",
    "935279": "Unlike the other classes, Sacriers love having thorns stuck in their feet and would rather not pull them out. The pain reminds them that they're alive and gives them the raging energy they need to slaughter their enemies. Plus, the drops of blood they leave behind make it impossible to get lost. They can always backtrack – which they wouldn't have been able to do as easily in poor quality shoes.",

    "980827": "Certain persistent rumours claim that Berylbell wanted to put a ring on Tom Stumb's finger. So she forged a metal ring in his likeness that was both an offering and a symbol of a promising partnership. Sadly, the librarian turned down her proposal, claiming that he wasn't really on the same page. Lady Copperbeard was left empty-handed... but chances are she hasn't said her last word on the subject.",

    "1010304": "<title iconSpellId=\"13057\"><b>Chargeable Spells</b></title>\nCras are especially effective archers when it comes to inflicting as much damage as possible at long distance in a single round.\n<br></br>\nTo do this, they have several spells that charge and become more powerful, which they can then use to finish off an opponent.\n<br></br>\nSome spells charge when cast on a target, multiple different targets successively, or when recast at regular intervals.\n<br></br>\n<title iconSpellId=\"13066\"><b>Improvement Spells</b></title>\nIn order to increase their potential for damage, Cras also have improvement spells at their disposal that can be used on themselves and/or their allies.\n<title iconSpellId=\"13053\"><b>Minimum Ranges</b></title>\nSince Cras are archers, close combat isn't their strong point. Thus, many of their spells have minimum ranges, which means that they cannot be cast unless the caster is far enough away from their targets.\n<br></br>",
    "1010305": "<title iconSpellId=\"13347\"><b>Summons</b></title>\nEnutrof summons are unique in that they heal the caster or their allies who inflict damage on them for up to 75% of the damage inflicted.\n<br></br>\nThese summons can be controlled by the summoner and play a few different roles:\n<br></br>\n<li>Tanking (Living Bag, Living Satchel & Treasure Chest)</li>\n<li>Positioning (Living Shovel)</li>\n<li>Damage (Living Chest & Living Spade)</li>\n<br></br>",
    "1010378": "<title iconSpellId=\"13444\"><b>Bombs</b></title>\nRogues can summon Bombs to the field on any unoccupied cell. Bombs are \"inert\" summons, meaning they don't use spells or move around.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nA Rogue can have up to 3 Bombs on the battlefield simultaneously, in the same element or not. Bombs are not counted in the caster's maximum number of summons. Their Health Points depend on the caster's level.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWhen a Bomb is summoned, it increases the AP cost of the spell that summoned it by 1 while it is alive. However, their variants, the Resilient Bombs, have a fixed AP cost.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nA Bomb can also be cast on an occupied cell. In this case, it explodes automatically and inflicts damage in its element on the target and surrounding entities in a radius of 2 cells. If the target is another of the caster's Bombs, it gains 1 Combo before exploding.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThere is a different type of Bomb for every element:\n<br></br>\n<li>Explobombs inflict Fire damage. Its damage is greater than the others when it forms a wall.</li>\n<li>Grenados inflict Air damage. They remove MP.</li>\n<li>Water Bombs inflict Water damage. They remove AP.</li>\n<li>Seismobombs inflict Earth damage. Its damage is greater than the others when it explodes.</li>\n<br></br>\nSeveral spells can be used to detonate a Bomb from a distance, either to simply deal damage or to be able to set another Bomb elsewhere on the battlefield.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nIf a Bomb is killed by some means other than a spell causing it to detonate, it will die normally without causing any damage or reductions.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n<title iconSpellId=\"13468\"><b>Combos & Explosions</b></title>\nAt the start of each turn, Rogues will give 2 Combos to each of their Bombs present on the field. Combos increase from 1 to a maximum of 15, and the status icon above each Bomb indicates its Combo level. \n<br></br>\nThe Combo increases the size of the Bombs and especially the damage they inflict via walls and explosions. \n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWhen a Bomb is summoned, it appears in Combo I.\n<br></br>\n<li>Combo Bonuses:</li>\n<br>\n- I: 0%\n- II: 20%\n- III: 40%\n- IV: 60%\n- V: 80%\n- VI: 100%\n- VII: 120%\n- VIII: 140%\n- IX: 160%\n- X: 190%\n- XI: 220%\n- XII: 250%\n- XIII: 280%\n- XIV: 320%\n- XV: 360%\n</br>\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWhen a Bomb explodes, if the caster's other Bombs are in the blast zone, they explode as well. Each Bomb's combo bonus is applied to the other Bombs in the zone, significantly increasing the damage done by each Bomb.\n<br></br>\n<title iconSpellId=\"13491\"><b>Bomb Walls</b></title>\nWhen at least 2 Bombs are in a line and 2 to 6 spaces apart, they automatically form a Bomb \"wall\". This appears as a glyph on the ground, which doesn't impede movement or line of sight. A wall can therefore be made of up to 3 bombs maximum.\n<br></br>\nAny entity that moves across or steps on the wall will take damage; the same applies to starting a turn inside the wall.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nMoving an entity into a wall will halt its movement and do damage to it. If this entity has already suffered the wall's effects during the turn, it will not be impeded and will not take damage if placed inside it again.\n<br></br>\nHowever, walking in the wall doesn't have this same once-per-turn limit; it will therefore inflict damage for every MP spent by the entity in the wall.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nIf one Bomb is linked to others by a wall and it explodes, it will detonate the other Bombs in the wall.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nAir walls, i.e. those formed by Grenados, reduce targets' MP immediately and at the start of the turn. Water walls, formed by Water Bombs, remove AP from entities that start their turn inside it.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWalls take advantage of half of the Combo to inflict their damage. Wall damage is also greatly reduced outside of the Rogue's and its summons' turns.\n<br></br>\n<title iconSpellId=\"13450\"><b>Kaboom</b></title>\nThe Kaboom and Imposture spells apply the Kaboom state on the caster and their allies, protecting them from damage caused by explosions and walls. The penalties applied by bomb explosions become bonuses that last for 3 turns; each can stack 1 time for a total of 3 bonuses maximum: \n<br></br>\n\n<li>Explobomb: 3 Range</li>\n<br></br><br></br>\n<li>Grenado: 1 MP</li>\n<br></br><br></br>\n<li>Water Bomb: 1 AP</li>\n<br></br><br></br>\n<li>Seismobomb: 7% Spell Damage</li>\n<br></br><br></br>",
    "1010380": "<title iconSpellId=\"13249\"><b>Teleportation</b></title>\nXelors have several spells that let them move ally or enemy targets or themselves.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThey have several different ways to teleport their targets:\n\n - Symmetrical teleportation:\n<br></br>\n\n<li>Relative to the spell caster</li>\n<li>Relative to the spell target</li>\n<li>Relative to the centre of the spell's area of effect</li>\n\n<br></br>\n\n - Teleporting the target to its previous location\n\n - Teleporting the target to its position at the start of the turn\n<br></br>\n<title iconStateId=\"244\"><b>Telefrags</b></title>\nTelefrags are generated when two entities switch places due to the teleportation effects of a Xelor spell. The Telefrag state is applied to the transposed targets for 2 turns.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThis state is represented by a pink gear above the characters. This state is only visible to the Xelor that applied it, and it cannot be removed via unbewitchment.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nFor each different spell that generated a Telefrag, the caster gains 2 AP for the current turn, up to once per spell and per turn.\nEach spell can only generate and trigger one Telefrag per casting. \n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nSome spells are more effective on targets with the Telefrag state. Depending on the spell, the Telefrag state may or may not be consumed.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThe Telefrag state cannot be applied to an allied Xelor. \n<br></br>\n<br></br>",
    "1010381": "<title iconSpellId=\"13748\"><b>Prey State</b></title>\nThe Prey state can be applied using the Prey and Venison spells. Many Ouginak spells are more effective when cast on an enemy target in the Prey state.\n<br></br>\nWhen an Ouginak or one of their allies inflicts damage on a Prey, they are healed for a portion of damage dealt to the Prey or inflict more damage.\n<br></br>\n<title iconSpellId=\"13776\"><b>Rage</b></title>\nIn every elemental path, Ouginaks have access to one or more spells that increase their Rage when used.\n<br></br>\nRage is a meter that goes from state 1 to 3. These states are symbolised by a hound's head (first yellow, then orange, finally red) that appears above the Ouginak. These states cannot be removed through unbewitchment.\n<br></br>\nThe first and second Rage state reduce damage received by the Ouginak, with a higher damage reduction bonus at Rage 2.\n<br></br>\nOn reaching Rage 3, the Ouginak transforms into their animal form.\n<br></br>\nSome spells require Rage states to be consumed in order to be used. It is therefore possible to delay the transformation.\n<br></br>\n<title iconSpellId=\"13746\"><b>Animal Form</b></title>\nAnimal form modifies the Ouginak's abilities: they gain a damage inflicted bonus, can only attack from at most 2 Range, and gain Movement Points. Their elemental spells, which allow them to move around or to move a target, do not have their Range reduced by this transformation. They also become Unlockable and can't use their weapon.\n<br></br>\nThe beastly transformation lasts 2 turns, during which time they lose access to some of their protection, health and movement spells.\n<br></br>\nAfter the second turn of the transformation, the Ouginak reverts to their normal form and loses all their Rage. Some spells allow them to end the transformation before the end of the second turn.",

It might mean that we don't have the right words to describe the thing in question, because it's completely unprecedented, because it's unlike anything we've ever known, or maybe also because we don't have the lexical knowledge necessary to choose the right words that will best express the indescribable nature of the thing. So we hide all this uncertainty behind phrases like, \"You see?! It's indescribable!\", said with deep conviction. But is that really the end of the story? \nIf we search deep inside, maybe an exact and appropriate description will reveal itself. Something sufficiently clear, and at the time sufficiently abstract to facilitate understanding of the described thing. If the words aren't sufficient, maybe it's necessary to invent new ones? Words coming from the heart. Words which speak for themselves when the limits of language have been reached. The indescribable, in the end, is actually an unknown, which requires only that we put forth the effort to understand it, to let your imagination, your reason, and your feelings intermingle in order to better understand and therefore find the words that could describe it.\nBut that would be too much work for a simple cape description.",

The first 3 are used to summon a creature from the family, while the last charge triggers the transformation.\n\nThese charges are displayed in a status bubble above the character. The bubble's colour indicates the element, and its shape shows what creature will be summoned. Charges cannot be unbewitched.\n\nIf the summoner uses several spells of the same element, and then a spell of a different element, the summoner doesn't gain another charge but already-earned charges will switch over to the new element.\n\nEach family consists of 3 summons with different colours: melanic, albino and colourful. Only one of each summons can exist per summoner in a single fight.\n\nThe Osamodas must use their elemental spells to earn summoning charges corresponding to the creature they want to summon. For example, to summon an Albino Toad, they must use 2 Water spells in a row, followed by a summoning spell.\n<title iconSpellId=\"13998\"><b>Summoning Spells</b></title>\nOsamodas can use 1 to 6 summoning spells: First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth.\n\nThese spells work in a special way. When cast, the consumed summoning charges determine what creature is summoned by the spell, rather than the spell itself.\n\nThis creature is linked to the spell that summoned it. When it dies, the spell's recast interval is set to a number of turns corresponding to the creature's type (melanic, albino, or colourful).\n\nRecasting the spell doesn't re-summon the creature; it moves the creature to the target cell. However, the creature loses all of its MP after the move.\n<title iconSpellId=\"13991\"><b>Osamodas's Whip and Animal Transformation</b></title>\nWhen the summoner accumulates 4 summoning charges, they undergo a transformation based on the charges' element and consume the charges. Allies near the Osamodas or their summons (no more than 2 cells away) earn the bonus corresponding to the transformation.\n\nThe transformation and associated bonuses last 2 turns. The effects stack from one transformation to the next (once in each element) and can't be unbewitched from the Osamodas.\n\n<li>Gobball: reduction in damage suffered</li>\n<li>Tofu: MP bonus</li>\n<li>Wyrmling: increase in final heals performed</li>\n<li>Toad: increase in final damage inflicted</li>",

However, Srams remain invisible after causing trap, poison or pushback damage.\n<br></br>\nCertain monster classes in the game have spells to reveal invisible entities. It is also possible to reduce or completely remove invisibility by unbewitching the invisible character.\n<br></br>\nWhen Srams lose their invisibility – either because the bonus has expired, an enemy has detected them, or they reveal themselves – they gain a Critical Hit bonus for 1 turn. This bonus is removed after the first Critical Hit landed during the turn.\n<br></br>\n<title iconSpellId=\"12921\"><b>Traps</b></title>\nSrams are able to set traps on the battlefield, exclusively on free cells. Traps can also be placed on a cell occupied by an Eliotrope Portal, but only if the portal is closed.\n<br></br>\nTraps are triggered when an entity walks over them or is summoned inside them.\n<br></br>\nSome traps have a placement zone that differs from its activation zone. For example, the Sickrat Trap occupies a single cell, but when an entity activates it, its effects are applied to all entities within a 3-cell cross around the placement cell.\n<br></br>\nThese single-cell traps with an area of effect can be triggered by the caster or their allies without affecting them. They will only be affected if they are inside the trap's area of effect, but not if they trigger it.\n<br></br>\n<title iconSpellId=\"12914\"><b>Trap Arrays</b></title>\nBy combining their various traps, Srams can create trap arrays, which are chains of several traps, to finish off an opponent.\n<br></br>\nThe traps' effects are triggered in the order in which the traps were set.\n<br></br>\nPositioning traps can therefore be used to link several damage traps. Pushing or pulling an enemy into the first trap in the array will then successively trigger the rest of the traps if they've been placed correctly.\n<br></br>\n<title iconSpellId=\"12915\"><b>The Double & the Plotter</b></title>\nThe Double spell and its Plotter variant both summon a double of the caster with all the same characteristics: Health Points, Dodge, Lock, Resistances, etc.\n<br></br>\nThe Double and the Plotter cannot cast any spells; they can only move around.\n<br></br>\nSome of the Sram's spells can be used to interact directly or indirectly with a double.

After reaching Evolution III, the Turret becomes controllable and unlocks its special spell and advanced spell.\n\nOnly one turret can be at Evolution III at any given time. If a Foggernaut already has a turret at Evolution III and upgrades a second turret from Evolution II to III, the first will revert to level II.\nWith Evolution III, offensive turrets also no longer have to attack allies, and defensive turrets no longer have to heal or block enemies.\n\n<subtitle>Evolution Bonuses</subtitle>\nEvolution levels II and III also enable Turrets to grant bonuses to their summoner. Each Turret gives different effects to its summoner; these are higher at Evolution III than at Evolution II and are only dissipated upon the death of the Turret. These bonuses apply for 1 turn if the Foggernaut is no more than 7 cells away from their Turret and in its line of sight.\n\n<subtitle>Special Spells and Advanced Spells</subtitle>\nTurrets' special spells, unlocked at Evolution III, cannot be used directly by the Turrets. For each of these, there is one spell and one variant in the Foggernaut's spell set that can be used to activate them.\nAdvanced spells, on the other hand, are active spells that can be used directly by the Turrets. These spells have more specific effects, distinct for each Turret, which must be used \"manually\", in contrast to the automatic spells.\n\nTurrets are not counted in the caster's maximum number of summons.\nThere can only be one of each kind of Turret per team. If this Turret is still on the field when placed again, the old one is destroyed to make room for the new one.\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"13820\"><b>Water Foggernauts</b></title>\nThe path of the ocean depths and the sailor on the high seas.\n<li>Free positioning, position swapping and MP debuff at long range</li>\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"13857\"><b>Earth Foggernauts</b></title>\nThe path of the mariner, master of rudder and rigging.\n<li>Positioning via Turrets, MP debuff and areas of effect at long range</li>\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"13824\"><b>Air Foggernauts</b></title>\nThe path of the buccaneer and sea winds.\n<li>Approaching and inflicting pushback damage</li>\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"13872\"><b>Fire Foggernauts</b></title>\nThe path of the mechanic, steam and electricity.\n<li>Damage via Turrets, penalties and areas of effect at medium range</li>",

    "1086903": "<title iconSpellId=\"29683\"><b>Ecaflip's Poker</b></title>\nThe Ecaflip class mechanic revolves around a card game – Ecaflip's Poker – enabling them to increase or inflict damage and heal or protect themself.\n\nThere are two parts to Ecaflip's Poker mechanic: the Hand and the Table. The Hand represents drawn Cards, and the Table represents played Cards.\n<li>Drawn Cards – the Hand – are manifested as states over the character's head, visible only to the character themself.</li><li>Played Cards – the Table – are manifested as bewitchments, visible to everyone.</li>\n\nSome spells can draw Cards, while others can play them, each in their own way.\nEach Card individually provides bonuses, but combining them reveals their full potential.\nThe aim of the game is to draw Cards to build up the best possible Hands – Winning Hands – which provide the most powerful effects.\n\nEcaflip's Poker is played with 16 different Cards, which can be drawn deterministically or randomly, depending on the spell.\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"30036\"><b>The Draw, the Hand, and Cards</b></title>\nAll of an Ecaflip's elemental spells and some utility spells enable them to draw Cards.\n\nThere can only be a single instance of each Card in the Hand, and a Hand can consist of up to four cards.\nOnce the Hand is full, it can no longer be modified. Cards are held indefinitely until they are played or discarded.\n\nEach Card is associated with an AP cost and an element – the AP cost determines the Card (or value), and the element determines its Suit.\nFor example, a spell costing 3 AP in the Fire element corresponds to the Queen of Hearts, and a spell costing 5 AP in the Air element corresponds to an Ace of Spades.\n<li>Spades: Air</li><li>Clubs: Water</li><li>Hearts: Fire</li><li>Diamonds: Earth</li><li>Jack: 2 AP</li><li>Queen: 3 AP</li><li>King: 4 AP</li><li>Ace: 5 AP</li>\n\nAll elemental paths have four spells, each of which enables you to draw one of the four cards from its suit.\nElemental spells always draw their associated Card, unless that Card is already in the Hand.\nEach Card also has a special spell that can either draw a Queen or play all of the Cards from its suit.\nPlaying Cards from the same suit enables you to free up space in your Hand and also improves the effects of the spell in question, depending on the Cards played.\n\nFinally, utility or multi-element spells are available to control the Hand by playing, drawing or discarding.\nSome spells draw one or more Cards randomly; most of these spells are free or have additional effects that are always worthwhile.\n\n<b>Unlucky Draw:</b> in the event of a random draw, 1 AP is returned if the Card drawn was already in the Hand.\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"29683\"><b>The Table</b></title>\nOnce the Cards in the Hand are played, they are placed on the Table, i.e. the list of your bewitchments.\nThey then become visible to everyone, take effect for 3 turns and can be unbewitched.\n\nEach Card individually grants bonuses based on its suit and value.\n<li>Spades: Pushback Damage</li><li>Clubs: Critical Hits</li><li>Hearts: Healing</li><li>Diamonds: Critical Resistance</li>\n\nIf the Hand is a Winning Hand, an additional bonus is granted. These bonuses also last 3 turns and\ncan be dissipated.\n\nEach Card or Winning Hand can only be present once on the Table.\n<b>Clean Slate:</b> when a new Hand is played, the Cards on the Table are discarded to make room for the new ones. Winning Hands are kept.\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"29810\"><b>Winning Hands</b></title>\nWinning Hands are the best Hands that can be obtained, as they provide the best effects and bonuses.\nThere are several types of Winning Hands: Straights, Four of a Kind, Three of a Kind and Double Pairs.\n\nList of Winning Hand compositions and their bonuses, from best to worst:\n<li>Four Aces: all 4 Aces</li><li>Kings and Aces: 2 Kings and 2 Aces</li><li>Three Aces: 3 Aces and another Card</li><li>Four Kings: all 4 Kings</li><li>Queens and Aces: 2 Queens and 2 Aces</li><li>Royal Straight with All Suits: 1 Jack, 1 King, 1 Queen and 1 Ace from different suits</li><li>Royal Straight in Spades: all Cards from the Spades suit</li><li>Royal Straight in Clubs: all Cards from the Clubs suit</li><li>Royal Straight in Hearts: all Cards from the Hearts suit</li><li>Royal Straight in Diamonds: all Cards from the Diamonds suit</li><li>Royal Straight: 1 Jack, 1 King, 1 Queen and 1 Ace</li><li>Queens and Kings: 2 Queens and 2 Kings</li><li>Jacks and Aces: 2 Jacks and 2 Aces</li><li>Three Kings: 3 Kings and another Card</li><li>Four Queens: all 4 Queens</li><li>Jacks and Kings: 2 Jacks and 2 Kings</li><li>Three Queens: 3 Queens and another Card</li><li>Jacks and Queens: 2 Jacks and 2 Queens</li><li>Four Jacks: all 4 Jacks</li><li>Four Suits: 4 Cards from different suits</li><li>Three Jacks: 3 Jacks and another card</li>\n\nWorse Winning Hands are not unlocked if a better one is also valid. For example, if the Hand has a Royal Straight with All Suits, it also has a Royal Straight, but the Royal Straight with All Suits will take priority.\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"29811\"><b>The Air Ecaflip</b></title>\nThe path of the agile feline and Cards from the Spades suit.\n<li>Movement for both the Ecaflip and their target</li>\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"29812\"><b>The Water Ecaflip</b></title>\nThe path of the lucky feline and Cards from the Clubs suit.\n<li>Random effects but fixed effects on a critical hit</li>\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"29813\"><b>The Fire Ecaflip</b></title>\nThe path of the cuddly feline and Cards from the Hearts suit.\n<li>Area-of-effect damage and healing</li>\n\n<title iconSpellId=\"29814\"><b>The Earth Ecaflip</b></title>\nThe path of the gambling warrior feline and Cards from the Diamonds suit.\n<li>Damage and a 50% chance of applying two different effects</li>",
