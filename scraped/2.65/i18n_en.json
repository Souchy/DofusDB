The first 3 are used to summon a creature from the family, while the last charge triggers the transformation.\n\nThese charges are displayed in a status bubble above the character. The bubble's colour indicates the element, and its shape shows what creature will be summoned. These bubbles are not visible to the Osamodas's opponents, and the charges cannot be unbewitched.\n\nIf the summoner uses several spells of the same element, and then a spell of a different element, the summoner doesn't gain another charge but already-earned charges will switch over to the new element.\n\nEach family consists of 3 summons with different colours: melanic, albino and colourful. Only one of each summons can exist per summoner in a single fight.\n\nThe Osamodas must use their elemental spells to earn summoning charges corresponding to the creature they want to summon. For example, to summon an Albino Toad, they must use 2 Water spells in a row, followed by a summoning spell.\n<title iconSpellId=\"13998\"><b>Summoning Spells</b></title>\nOsamodas can use 1 to 6 summoning spells: First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth.\n\nThese spells work in a special way. When cast, the consumed summoning charges determine what creature is summoned by the spell, rather than the spell itself.\n\nThis creature is linked to the spell that summoned it. When it dies, the spell's recast interval is set to a number of turns corresponding to the creature's type (melanic, albino, or colourful).\n\nRecasting the spell doesn't re-summon the creature; it moves the creature to the target cell.\n<title iconSpellId=\"13991\"><b>Osamodas's Whip and Animal Transformation</b></title>\nWhen the summoner accumulates 4 summoning charges, they undergo a transformation based on the charges' element and consume the charges. Allies near the Osamodas or their summons (no more than 2 cells away) earn the bonus corresponding to the transformation.\n\nThe transformation and associated bonuses last 2 turns. The effects stack from one transformation to the next (twice in each element) and can't be unbewitched from the Osamodas.\n\n<li>Gobball: reduces damage taken</li>\n<li>Tofu: MP bonus</li>\n<li>Wyrmling: heals allies\n(doubled when their HP is low)</li>\n<li>Toad: damage bonus</li>",

They are placed on free cells that do not have traps on them.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nPortals are used to teleport entities that move onto or are positioned on them (allies, enemies, monsters, etc.), and to launch spells through them.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nSpells have increased damage and healing when launched through portals. The farther away from each other the portals are, the higher the bonus.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n<subtitle>Network and Redirection:</subtitle>\nPortals are connected to each other, forming a \"network\". There must be 2 active portals for a network to form.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nSpells cast through a portal, as well as push or pull manoeuvres that send an entity into a portal, \"project\" the spell or entity through the exit portal. This projection functions as a vector, which maintains the distance and direction of the spell casting or movement to determine the destination cell.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nAn entity or spell that enters the network will go from the \"entrance portal\" to the nearest portal, and so on without passing through the same portal twice, to arrive at the last portal, the \"exit portal\".\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nIf several portals are an equal distance apart, timing is prioritised to determine the order in which portals are travelled through by a spell or relocated entity.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nHovering the mouse over the network will offer a preview of how it redirects spells and relocations.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWeapons cannot be used through portals.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n<subtitle>Destination Cell:</subtitle>\nIf the destination portal is unavailable (occupied by an entity or an obstacle), the portal cannot be used. A portal cannot be placed on a cell already containing a portal.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nLine-of-sight restrictions still apply to spells even if they are cast through a network and the theoretical destination cell is located behind an obstacle.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nDepending on how an entity or spell enters the network, the destination cell differs:\n<br></br>\n<li>Via walking: the entity arrives at the cell where the destination portal is located.</li>\n<li>Via (spell) casting: the entity arrives at the cell using the vector between the caster's position and the entrance portal.</li>\n<li>Via teleportation: the entity arrives at the cell using the vector between the caster's position and the entrance portal.</li>\n<li>By being pushed: the entity arrives at the cell where the destination portal is located. If the push manoeuvre is interrupted by the entrance portal, the \"missing\" push is applied from the destination cell (using the push vector).</li>\n<li>By being pulled: the entity arrives at the cell where the destination portal is located. If the pull manoeuvre is interrupted by the entrance portal, the \"missing\" pull is applied from the destination cell (using the pull vector).</li>\n<subtitle>Portals and Teams:</subtitle>\nPortals take the colour of their team (red or blue). A team is limited to 4 portals, even if there are several Eliotropes on the team.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThe networks of two enemy Eliotropes will not communicate with each other.  However, all portals can be used by either allies or enemies.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nEnemies (not including summons) are unable to pass through an enemy portal on the first turn of the game.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWhen an Eliotrope dies, their portals disappear.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n<subtitle>Activation:</subtitle>\nWhen a portal is placed, it is open by default and therefore part of a network.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nPortals can be closed using the Neutral and Interruption spells. A closed portal is no longer part of the network of portals until the start of the Eliotrope's next turn.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThe Neutral spell is not cast through the network; it directly closes the targeted portal.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nOn the contrary, the Portal spell can be cast through a network.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nStanding on a deactivated portal that becomes active again will not teleport the entity.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nCasting a spell through a portal network doesn't deactivate the portals. A character may therefore cast spells through it as many times as they want during their turn.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nHowever, if an entity walks into or is moved into the network, the entrance and exit portals will be inactive for the entity's current turn, to be reactivated at the start of the next active entity's turn.\n<subtitle>Order:</subtitle>\nPortals are numbered from 1 to 4. The first portal placed is number 1, and the following portals go up to 4.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWhen an Eliotrope or their team can't set down any more portals, placing another portal will replace the oldest one.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThe new portal then becomes number 4, number 2 becomes 1, and so on.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nHovering the mouse over a portal will show the order of portals.",

If the target is another of the caster's Bombs, it gains 1 Combo before exploding.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThere is a different type of Bomb for every element:\n<br></br>\n<li>Explobombs inflict Fire damage.

This is also true for Water walls, but they reduce AP.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nWalls take advantage of half of the Combo to inflict their damage.

There are 6 turrets, and each performs very different roles depending on the summoner's needs.\n\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n\n<li>Harpooner and Drill (Damage, Unbewitchment and Erosion)</li>\n<li>Lifesaver and Bathyscaphe (Healing, Protection and Enhancement)</li>\n<li>Tacturret and Trawler (Positioning and Interference)</li>\n\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n\nEach turret has an active spell it uses on its turn, which affects both allies and enemies.\n\n<subtitle>Upgrading Turrets</subtitle>\n\nThe unique feature of these summons is that they can be improved; the Foggernaut can use the Evolution and Transition spells to upgrade turrets. Upgrading a turret heals it by 100% of its HP.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nThey're at Evolution I by default, and they go up to Evolution II, then III. After reaching Evolution III, the turret unlocks its special spell.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nOne turret can be improved per turn, and only one turret can be at Evolution III at one time. If one already has a turret at Evolution III and upgrades a second turret from Evolution II to III, the first turret will revert to level II.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nEvolution III also makes it so offensive turrets no longer have to attack allies, and defensive turrets no longer have to heal or block enemies.\n\n<subtitle>Evolution Bonuses</subtitle>\n\nEvolution levels II and III also allow turrets to grant bonuses to their summoner. Each turret gives different bonuses to its summoner; the bonuses are higher at Evolution III than at II and can only be dissipated with the death of the turret. These bonuses apply for 1 turn if the Foggernaut is no more than 7 cells away and in the turret's line of sight.\n\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n\n<li>Harpooner¬†‚Äì Evolution II: 50¬†/ 100¬†/ 150 Power; Evolution III: 100¬†/ 150¬†/ 200 Power</li>\n<li>Drill¬†‚Äì Evolution II: 15¬†/ 20 Damage; Evolution III: 20¬†/ 25 Damage and 1 MP</li>\n<li>Lifesaver¬†‚Äì Evolution II: 6%¬†/ 9%¬†/ 12% Vitality; Evolution III: 9%¬†/ 12%¬†/ 15% Vitality</li>\n<li>Bathyscaphe¬†‚Äì Evolution II: 100% of level as shield; Evolution III: 100% of level as shield and 1 AP</li>\n<li>Tacturret¬†‚Äì Evolution II: 1¬†/ 1¬†/ 2 Range; Evolution III: 2¬†/ 2¬†/ 3 Range</li>\n<li>Trawler¬†‚Äì Evolution II: 25¬†/ 30 Lock and 25¬†/ 30 MP Reduction; Evolution III: 30¬†/ 40 Lock and 30¬†/ 40 MP Reduction</li>\n\n<br></br>\n\n<subtitle>Special Spells</subtitle>\n\nTurrets' special spells, unlocked at Evolution III, cannot be used directly by the turrets. Instead, the Foggernaut has a spell and a variant that both activate their turret's special spell.\n\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n\n<li>Boomboom (damage and unbewitchment): special spell for the Harpooner, triggered by the Ambush and Sonar spells</li>\n<li>Excavation (damage and erosion): special spell for the Drill, triggered by the Ambush and Sonar spells</li>\n<li>Intervention (healing and protection): special spell for the Lifesaver, triggered by the First Aid and Rescue spells</li>\n<li>Decompression (AP bonuses and shield): special spell for the Bathyscaphe, triggered by the First Aid and Rescue spells</li>\n<li>Transko (switches places): special spell for the Tacturret, triggered by the Spyglass and Periscope spells</li>\n<li>Trawling (MP reduction): special spell for the Trawler, triggered by the Spyglass and Periscope spells</li>\n\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n\nTurrets are not counted in the caster's maximum number of summons.",
